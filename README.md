# Taste Buds Unite (First SMU Group Project)

## Description

We're building an app where users can enter the main ingredient or the type of food they want to make. Once they do that, the app will show them a list of meal ideas they can cook with that ingredient or cuisine in mind.

### User Story

```
AS THE primary cook for the household
I WANT to find ways to mix our weekly meals up with fresh ingredients
SO THAT I can create a more diverse meal prep
```
